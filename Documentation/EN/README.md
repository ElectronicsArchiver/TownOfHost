## About this mod

This mod is not affiliated with Among Us or Innersloth, so don't ask about this mod for Innersloth.<br>

## Features

Only host has to install this mod to play with this mod, so other player doesn't have to install it. Probably, players on any devices can play this mod.<br>
But custom roles in the mod replace offical mods, so custom roles that replace the same official roles cannot be used at the same time.<br>
